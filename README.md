# Fox-Adoption-Centre
You can adopt Foxes here~

Coded by Jayden Lee.
Please do NOT attempt to decode the encrypted script, as they are encrypted for a reason.
The webhook in the early versions are defaulted to my private webhook, but in later versions there should be a choice where you can enter your own!

# WHAT IT DOES
It generates fox images using a public api, https://randomfox.ca/floof. Then it sends the images to a webhook, and also prints the link of the image in the terminal! Sadly, there are only 123 fox variants available now, I hope they update the api soon~

# HOW TO USE
First, download the files from the "*Release*" section.

Then, run the python script!

# SUPER IMPORTANT NOTE
